//INSTRUCTIONS TO SETUP
  //Change idModel in trelloHandler.js located in public/javascripts to the board id that you want to create a webhook for.
  //Change the callbackURL in the trello.js file located in routes using the url from ngrok ('ngrok http 3000')
  //Start the program in your shell by 'yarn run start'
  //If a webhook has not been created yet for the board, go to localhost:3000 and click the button to create a webhook
  //Once a webhook is created, the formatted callback responses will be printed in the console.
